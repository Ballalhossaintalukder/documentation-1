To provide clearer distinction in our support services, we've renamed Pantheon's 'On-call help' to 'Emergency ticket.' This change is intended to clarify the scope of the service.

* **Emergency ticket**: Available exclusively to Platinum and Diamond customers, this option is intended for business-critical issues that require immediate attention. Emergency tickets are escalated directly to our support engineers, including during off-hours, ensuring rapid response and resolution.
* **General support ticket**: Available to Gold, Platinum, and Diamond customers for all types of support needs. Gold customers should use this option to report site downtime, and it will be addressed with timely assistance.

You can access the Emergency ticket option from the Support tab of your dashboard. Learn more about [support features for different account tiers](/guides/support/#support-features-and-response-times).
