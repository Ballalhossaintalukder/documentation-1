Pantheon is updating our SFTP access control, requiring the use of SSH keys starting <strong>April 30, 2024</strong>. Access via Pantheon usernames and passwords will be disabled.

You'll still access the web dashboard with your username/password or Single Sign-On, but SFTP access (e.g., via terminal or applications like Filezilla or Cyberduck) will need an [SSH key](/ssh-keys).

We are making this change to maintain a secure and reliable platform. Learn how to configure your SFTP client with SSH keys in our [documentation](/guides/sftp/sftp-connection-info#authenticating).
