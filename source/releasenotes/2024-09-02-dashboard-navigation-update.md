Pantheon has updated the look and feel of the Pantheon Dashboard navigation, improving its responsiveness on smaller devices. While all functionality remains the same, an update to the location of the workspace selection tool has increased its prominence on screen. 

### Highlights
- **Responsive Behavior** The updated navigation design is responsive, quickly adapting to smaller screen sizes such as mobile devices.
- **Narrow, Expand Navigation Actions** Users can click to narrow the navigation for more working room on their screens, and then click again to expand the navigation to its original size.
- **Direct Access to Subsections** Users are now able to access subsections of larger areas of the dashboard, such as Sites or Settings, directly from the Navigation
