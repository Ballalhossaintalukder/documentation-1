Site labels can now be renamed self-serve via Terminus with the new `site:label:set` command. Previously, updating a site's label was only possible by contacting support.

A site on Pantheon has both a machine name and a human-readable label.
* Machine name (e.g., `my-awesome-site`): used in [Terminus commands](/terminus/examples#siteenv), constructs [platform domains](/guides/domains), and cannot be changed after site creation
* Human-readable label (e.g., `My Awesome Site`): shown in the Pantheon workspace, site dashboards, and can be changed after site creation via Terminus. For example:  

```shell{promptUser: user}
terminus site:label:set my-awesome-site "My Awesome Site D11"
```

Upgrade today to leverage this new command.
