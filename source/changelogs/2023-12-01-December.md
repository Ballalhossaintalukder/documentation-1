## Platform Updates

### Upgraded Security Measures for Uninterrupted WebOps Experience
We're thrilled to announce an impactful upgrade to Pantheon's security infrastructure, reinforcing our commitment to safeguarding your websites. In response to the escalating sophistication of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, we've implemented innovative solutions to fortify our defenses. Particularly, we've addressed a surge in Layer 7 attacks targeting content management systems, ensuring resilience even without our Advanced Global CDN's Web Application Firewall (WAF).

**Key benefits:**
* **Advanced DDoS protection**: Our engineers have proactively countered Layer 7 attacks, mitigating risks posed by inauthentic traffic targeting web content management systems.
* **Rate limiting capabilities**: We've introduced rate limiting capabilities within our Global CDN, curbing abusive traffic effectively. This ensures a stable online presence, even during large-scale attacks, preventing wider stability issues.
