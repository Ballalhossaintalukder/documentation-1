We're thrilled to announce the availability of WP-CLI v2.11.0 on the Pantheon platform.

WP-CLI is easily accessible for any WordPress site on Pantheon through our CLI, [Terminus](/terminus). Manage your WordPress installations efficiently with the power of WP-CLI at your fingertips.

<h3>Highlights</h3>

* **New Site Generator Command:**
This new command has been added to create multiple sites programmatically in a multisite installation. This is useful for testing or development purposes.

* **GitHub Release Installation Support:**
The extension command now supports installing plugins and themes directly from GitHub releases.

* **Adds minor and patch limitations to theme updates:**
Now, like plugins, themes can be updated only to their latest minor or patch releases

* **New "user exists" command**
A new `wp use exists` command allows for quick checks on whether a user exists in the WordPress database.

* **Option to delete unknown image sizes**
The new `--delete-unknown` flag added to `wp media regenerate` may be of particular interest to site owners dealing with [highly populated media directories](/2024/08/prevent-filesystem-overload).

* **Bug fixes:**
WP-CLI 2.11.0 fixes "a lot of small and not so small bugs" with more than 250 pull requests merged.
