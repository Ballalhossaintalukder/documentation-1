**New Relic Synthetics: New monthly Check limits**

Beginning on May 1st, 2024, Pantheon will begin limiting the number of Synthetics checks for each Pantheon account.
* Each Pantheon account will have the option to run up to 10,000 New Relic Synthetic checks per month.
* Pantheon provides a monthly shared number of synthetic checks for all Pantheon customers each month. To ensure that all Pantheon users can use Synthetics, we ask customers to reduce their checks to <10,000 per month per Pantheon account.
* Starting May 1st, 2024, Pantheon will take action and reduce the number of checks in Pantheon accounts exceeding the 10,000 checks per month limit.
* Pantheon will not delete synthetic monitors or historical data but will reduce the frequency and the number of locations the monitor runs from.
* If you have any questions, please feel free to contact [Pantheon Support , https://pantheon.io/support].
