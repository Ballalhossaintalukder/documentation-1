Effective May 12th - We will begin rolling out SendGrid to send transactional emails.
* Pantheon will begin using SendGrid to send customer transactional emails via rest API during the week of May 12th, 2024 (we expect the full cutover to be complete by the end of May).
* You don't need to make any changes (Pantheon will manage the cutover).
* All emails sent via SMTP forwarding will not be changed, and no impact should be expected.
