# New Release Notes Structure

For nearly a decade, we have published a monthly "changelog" here within our Documentation site that summarizes significant changes to the platform.
Going forward in 2024 we are changing some of the details of how we publish and organize this information.

Rather than treating the monthly retrospective as the base unit of information, we will instead publish a new "Release Note" for each significant change to the platform as needed, rather than waiting for the monthly summary.

This switch will support more proactive communication and ensure that any noteworthy change is marked here in addition to the blog posts, emails, and other channels we use to communicate with our customers.

Here you will find:
* A listing of all Release Notes at docs.pantheon.io/release-notes
* A listing of Release Notes by category like docs.pantheon.io/release-notes/infrastructure
#  todo or should it be docs.pantheon.io/release-notes/all/2023/12 ?
* A month-by-month breakdown of all Release Notes like docs.pantheon.io/release-notes/all/2023-12
* A month-by-month breakdown of Release Notes by catetory and month like docs.pantheon.io/release-notes/infrastructure/2023-12
