As part of our continued effort to protect sites on our platform, Pantheon now requires all sites on the platform to prove domain ownership via TXT records. This enhances security by ensuring domain ownership and protection, safeguarding against domain hijacking by malicious actors. 

<h3>Highlights</h3>

* Easily validate domain ownership within the Pantheon dashboard.
* Validated domains are protected from hijacking.
* Aligns with industry-standard DNS practices.
