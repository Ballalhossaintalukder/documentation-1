**APCu** is a user-accessible PHP cache. Pantheon provides APCu by default across all plans, but the size of the APCu memory cache ([apc.shm_size](https://www.php.net/manual/en/apcu.configuration.php#ini.apcu.shm-size)) varies depending on the service level. See the [Application Containers overview](/application-containers) to learn more about APCu on Pantheon's container architecture.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can APCu be used as a cache backend on Pantheon?

Yes, APCu can be used as a cache backend or a "key-value store"; however, this is not recommended. APCu lacks the ability to span multiple application containers. Instead, Pantheon provides a Redis-basedÂ [Object Cache](/object-cache) as a caching backend for Drupal and WordPress, which has coherence across multiple [application containers](/application-containers).

### How can I determine what my current APCu settings are?

Search for `shm_size` in [phpinfo](/guides/secure-development/phpinfo).

As this is not a runtime configuration, the `shm_size` cannot be changed across site environments and is determined by the site plan tier. Currently, Sandbox sites and Basic site plans are given a `shm_size` or 128 MB. Performance site plans and higher have a larger `shm_size` entitlement of 256 MB. 

## Does "Clear Caches" Affect ACPu

No. The **Clear Caches** button in the Site Dashboard does not interact with APCu. The function [`apcu_clear_cache`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.apcu-clear-cache.php) will clear the APCu cache for a single application container.
